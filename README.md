# watchallrepos
A Python script to watch your repositories (and any that you have push access to) if didn't enable the option to auto-subscribe when starting to use GitHub. The script won't *unsubscribe* you from anything, so if you don't want to watch forked repos, pass the correct parameter (`-s`).
